CODEBUILD OVERVIEW: Build and Test Applications.

	- Fully managed build service.
	- Continuous Scaling. 
	- Pay for usage: TIME it takes to complete the build.
	- Leverages Docker under the hood for reproducible builds.
	- Integration with KMS, and AWS Cloud Security.
	
	*Build instructions can be defined in code: ( buildspec.yml file )
	
	- Output logs to Amazon S3 & AWS CloudWatch Logs
	- Use CloudWatch alarms to detect failed builds and trigger notifications. 
	- SNS Notifications
	- Builds can be defined within CodeBuild or CodePipeline itself.

	CODEBUILD SUPPORT ENVIRNMENTS:
		- Java
		- Ruby
		- Python
		- Go
		- Node.js
		- Android 
		- .Net Core
		- PHP
		- Docker: extend any envirnment you like.

 *Can use a AWS S3 Cache Bucket to cache things like dependencies, artifacts, etc. to increase performance.

	buildspec.yml: Must be at the root of your code.
		Define Environment Variables:
			- Plaintext variables
			- Secure secrets: use SSM Parameter store.
		Phases(specify commands to run):
			(1)Install: Install dependencies you may need for your build/
			(2)Pre build: final commands to execute before build/
			(3)Build: actual build commands.
			(4)Post-Build: finishing touches(zip output for example)
		Artifacts: What to upload to S3 (Encrypted with KMS)
		Cache: Files to cache (usually dependencies) to S3 for future speed up.

	*Can use Local CodeBuild agent for complex troubleshooting.

	BUILDSPEC: Specified when configuring in CodeBuild environment.
