AWS COGNITO OVERVIEW:

	We want to give our users an identity so that they can interact with our application.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	(1)COGNITO USER POOLS (CUP):
		- Sign in functionality for all app users
		- Integrate with API Gateway
		- Create Serverless database of user for your mobile apps
		- Simple Login: Username (or email) / password combination
		- Possibility to verify emails / phone numbers and add MFA
		- Can enable Federated Identities (Facebook, Google, SAML)
		- Sends back a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) 
		- Can be integrated with API Gatewat for authentication
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	(2)COGNITO IDENTITY POOLS (FEDERATED IDENTITY (FIP)):
		- Provide AWS Credentials directly to our app users so that they can access our reso			urces directly.
		- Integrate with Cognito User Pools as an identity provider
		GOALS: To provide direct access to AWS Resources from client side.
			HOW:
		- Log in to federated identity provider - or remain anonymous
		- Get tremporary AWS credentials back from the Federated Identity Pool
		- These credentials come with a pre-defined IAM policy stating permissions 	
 		- STS Provides Temporary security credentials
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	(3)COGNITO SYNC(DEPRECATED): 
		- Synchronize data from device to Cognito.
		- May be deprecated and replaced by AppSync.
		- Store preferences, configuration, state of app
		- Cross device synchronization (Any platform)
		- Offline capability (synchronization when back online)
		- Requires FederatedIdentity Pool in Cognito (Not user Pool)
		- Stored data in datasets (up to 1MB)
		- Up to 20 datasets to synchronize.
