AWS CODEDEPLOY OVERVIEW: We want to deploy our application automatically to many EC2 Instance.
	
	AWS CodeDeploy is a managed service.
	
	Each EC2 Machine (Or on premise machine) must be running: CodeDeploy Agent
	CodeDeploy sends appspec.yml



	APPSPEC.YML FILE( appspec.yml ):
		Hooks(remember_order):
		(1) ApplicationStop: Stops current application.
		(2) DownloadBundle: Describes how to download my new application.
		(3) BeforeInstall: Allows any preparation before installing new version.
		(4) AfterInstall: Describes any clean up/server launch after installation.
		(5) ApplicationStart: How to start new application.
		(6) ValidateService(*REALLY IMPORTANT*): How to make sure application is working. 

	DEPLOYMENT CONFIG:
		- One a time: one instance at a time
		- In-Place deployment | Half at a time: 50%
		- Blue/Green deployment: New ASG, switch URL.
		- All at once: Quick but Downtime
		- Custom: EX: min healthy host 75%
	DEPLOYMENT FAILURES:
		- Instances stay in a failed state.
		- New deployments will first be deployed to "failed state" instances
		- To rollback: redeploy old deployments, or enable automated rollbacks
	DEPLOYMENT TARGETS:
		- Set of EC2 instances with tags.
		- Directly to ASG.
		- Mix of ASG/Tags, can build deployment segments.
		- Customization in scripts with DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_NAME envirnment variables.


HANDS ON CODEDEPLOY NOTES:
	(1) Create 2 new IAM Roles:
		- Service Role for CodeDeploy -> Attached Permissions Policy: AWSCodeDeployRole
		- EC2 Service Role -> S3 -> ReadOnlyAccess 
	(2) Create Application: EC2/On-premises, AWS Lambda, or Amazon ECS.
	(3a) Create a new EC2 Instance to deploy to -> generic EC2, Security group: SSH(20),HTTP(80)
		-SSH into instance
		-Install CodeDeploy Agent on this machine using the following commands:
   		 - 'sudo yum update'
		 - 'sudo install ruby'
		 - 'wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/install'
		 - 'chmod +x ./install' : Makes installed file ^ Executable
		 - 'sudo ./install auto' : Executes CodeDeploy install
		 - 'sudo service codedeploy-agent status
		 - Disconnect from instance
	(3b) Create deployment group: Sets of EC2 Instances to deploy application to.
		-Key: Environment, Value: Dev		
	 *All instances that MATCH KEY/VALUE pair will be apart of the deployment group.
	
	(4) Go to Application in CodeDeploy and Link "Deployment Group"
	(5) Where is Application: S3 or Github.
