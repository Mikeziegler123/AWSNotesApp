AWS CODECOMMIT OVERVIEW: Store Our Code.

CODECOMMIT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Version Control: The ability to understand the various changes that happened to the code over time, and possibly roll back.
	- All these are enables by using a version control system such as Git.
	- A Git repository can live on one's machine, but it usually lives on a central online repository.
	Benefits are:
		- Collaborate with other developers.
		- Make sure the code is backed-up somewhere.
		- Make sure it's fully viewable and auditable.
	More:	
	-> No size limit on repositories.
	-> Fully managed, highly available.
	-> Code only in AWS cloud account.
	-> Secure (encrypted, access control, etc...)
	-> Integrated with Jenkins/CodeBuild/Other CI tools.
	
	CODECOMMIT SECURITY:
	  - Interactions done using Git(standard)
	  
	 -> AUTHENTICATION IN GIT:
	     - SSH Keys: AWS Users can configure SSH Keys in their IAM console.
	     - HTTPS: Done through the AWS CLI Authentication helper or Generating HTTPS credentials
	     - MFA (multi-factor authentication) can be enabled for extra safety.
	 
	  -> AUTHORIZATION IN GIT: 
	     - IAM Policies manage user / roles rights to repositories
	  
	  -> ENCRYPTION:
	     - Repositories are automatically *encrypted-at-rest using KMS*
	     - Encrypted in transit (can only use HTTPS or SSH = both secure)
	  
	  -> CROSS ACCOUNT ACCESS:
	     - Do not share SSH Keys.
	     - Do Not share your AWS credentials
	     - Use IAM Role in your AWS Account and use AWS STS(With AssumeRole API)

	  -> NOTES: GitHub Users - AWS IAM users & Roles.

	CODECOMMIT NOTIFICATIONS: You can trigger notifications in CodeCOmmit using AWS SNS, or
	AWS Lambda, or AWS CloudWatch Event Rules.
		
		SNS:
		- Deletion of branches.
		- Trigger for pushes that happens in master branch.
		- Notify external Build System.

		CLOUDWATCH EVENT RULES:
		- Trigger for pull request updates (created / updated / deleted / commented)
		- Commit comment events
		- CloudWatch Event Rules goes into an SNS topic.

	*Notifications: Pull Request/Commit Comment Events, etc...
	*Triggers: Code related Events, Pushing code, creating branch, deleting branches, etc...
