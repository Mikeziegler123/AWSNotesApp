CICD: Continuous Integration Continuous Deployment/Delivery : Automating to Increase Safety.

	AWS CODECOMMIT: Store Our Code.

	AWS CODEPIPELINE: Automating our pipeline from code to ElasticBeanStalk. 

	AWS CODEBUILD: Building & testing our code.

	AWS CODEDEPLOY: Deploying the code to EC2 fleets (not BeanStalk).

	CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION: 
		(1) Developers push the code to a code repository often.
							       EX(s):  	- *CodeCommit
									- GitHub
									- BitBucket
									- Etc. . . 

		(2) Testing/Build Server: Builds and tests the code as soon as it's pushed.
								EX(s):  - *CodeBuild
									- Jenkins CI
		    BENEFITS:		  					- Etc. . . 
			- Find Bugs early, fix bugs.
			- Deliver faster as code is tested.
			- Deploy Often.
			- Happier developers, as they're unblocked.

	
	CONTINUOUS DELIVERY:
		- Ensure that software can be released reliably whenever needed. 
		- Ensure deployments happen often, and are quick.	
		- Shift away from "one release every 3 months" to "5 releases a day".
		- That usually means automated deployment:
								EX(s):  - *CodeDeploy
									- Jenkins CD
									- Spinnaker
									- Etc. . .
