EC2 cababilities: 
	- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
	- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	- Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

How to connect to Instance using cmd(SSH):
OS:inux/Mac
(1)   chmod 0400 C:\Users\Mikez\Documents\keypair2.pem
(2)   ssh -i C:\Users\Mikez\Documents\keypair2.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-91-251-193.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Putty(Windows): Need to convert .PEM file to .PPK - compatible key file with Putty.
OS: Windoows
(1) Use PuttyGen.exe to convert .PEM file to .PPK file
(2) Locate .PPK File via Putty->SSH->Auth->Load

To get no security error(yes/no) in cmd:
Note:.PEM File must have properties so that ownership/full control is in the name of the user.  

SSH Troubleshooting

1) There's a connection timeout
This is a security group issue. Any timeout (not just for SSH) is related to security groups or a firewall. Ensure your security group looks like this and correctly assigned to your EC2 instance.

2) There's still a connection timeout issue
If your security group is properly configured as above, and you still have connection timeout issues, then that means a corporate firewall or a personal firewall is blocking the connection. Please use EC2 Instance Connect as described in the next lecture.

3) SSH does not work on Windows
If it says: ssh command not found, that means you have to use Putty
Follow again the video. If things don't work, please use EC2 Instance Connect as described in the next lecture

4) There's a connection refused
This means the instance is reachable, but no SSH utility is running on the instance
Try to restart the instance
If it doesn't work, terminate the instance and create a new one. Make sure you're using Amazon Linux

5)  Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)
This means either two things:
You are using the wrong security key or not using a security key. Please look at your EC2 instance cconfiguration to make sure you have assigned the correct key to it.
You are using the wrong user. Make sure you have started an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance, and make sure you're using the user ec2-user. This is something you specify when doing ec2-user@<public-ip> (ex: ec2-user@35.180.242.162) in your SSH command or your Putty configuration

6) Nothing is working - "aaaahhhhhh"
Don't panic. Use EC2 Instance Connect from the next lecture. Make sure you started an Amazon Linux 2 and you will be able to follow along with the tutorial :)

7) I was able to connect yesterday, but today I can't
This is probably because you have stopped your EC2 instance and then started it again today. When you do so, the public IP of your EC2 instance will change. Therefore, in your command, or Putty configduration, please make sure to edit and save the new public IP.

Bootstrapping EC2 instances using EC2 User data scripts:
	Bootstrapping: Launching commands when a machine starts
		Install updates
		Install software
		Downloading common files from the internet
		
	Example User Data Input:

		#!bin/bash
		# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
		yum update -y
		yum install -y httpd.x86_64
		systemctl start httpd.service
		system enable httpd.service
		echo "Hello World - Mike $(hostname -f)" > /var/www/html/index.html

EC2 Instance Launch Types:
	On Demand Instances:*Good for short-term and un-interupted workloads, with unknown behavior.
		Pay for what you use, highest Cost, No up front payment, No long term commtment 
	
	Reserved Instances:*Good for steady state usage applications (think database).
		Up to 75% discount compared to On Demand, Pay upfront, 1-3 reservation period
	
	Convertable Reserved Instances: 
		Can change the EC2 instance type
		Up to 54% discount
		
	
	Scheduled Reserved Instances:
		launch within time window you reserve
		whenm you require a fraction of day\week\month
	
	Spot Instances:*Good for Batch jobs, Big Data Analysis, workloads resilient to failure.
		Up to 9-% compared to On Demand
		Bid a price, and get instance as long as it's under the price
		Price varies based on offer & demand
		Spot instances are reclaimed with a 2 minute notification warning when the spot 						price goes above your bid.
		
	Dedicated Hosts :*Good for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL-Bring You		r Own License)
		Full control of EC2 instance placement
		Visibility into underlying sockets/physical cores of the hardware
		Allocated for a 3 year perios
		More Expensive
		
	Dedicated Instances:
		May share hardware with other instances in same account.
			

EC2 PRICING:

	You do not pay for the instance, if the instance is Stopped.


CUSTOM AMI:
	Can be done to:
		speed up boot time
		pre-install packkages
		AD Integration
		Install app ahead of time.
	IMPORTANT: When you build an AMI, if it REGION SPECIFIC!

Instances have 5 Distinct Characteristics:
	RAM, CPU, I/O, NETWORK, GPU
	
	Instance Types:
		-Specialized: R/C/P/G/H/X/I/F/Z/CR
		-Balanced: M Instances
		-Burstable: T2, T3
		 	- OK CPU performance, until machine needs to process something unexpected.
			- Shifts to a Super CPU Boost mode, until "burst credits" are unavalable. 
			- Credits are replenished over time.
		-T2 Unlimited: never lose performance, charged for credits used. 


ELASTIC BLOCK STORE: (Availability Zone level)
	Types:  GP2 (SSD) General Purpose
		IOI (SSD) Highest performance SSD Volume
		STI (HDD) Low Cost Frequently accessed (Big Data) Workloads
		SC1 (HDD) Lowest cost for less frequently accessed workloads
	EBS Volumes are characterized in Size | ThroughputMb/sec | IOPS
	Usually will use GP2 EBS Volumes

	You can resize EBS Volumes, repartition after resizing to use full capacity.

EBS SNAPSHOTS:  Used to back up EBS Volumes
		Snapshots only take actual space on the drive
		Used for: Backups, Volume migration: Resizing, Changing Volume Type, EBS Encryption

EBS ENCRYPTION: Encrypted EBS Volume
		Encrypted at rest & in flight
		All snapshots are Encrypted
		Volumes created from snapshot are also encrypted
		Encryption has minimal impact on latency
		EBS Encrypted leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
		Copy an unencrypted Volume, can then be Encrypted

INSTANCE STORE: Better I/O Performance
		Can't resize Instance Stores
		Backups must be operated by user


AWS EC2 INSTANCE METADATA: Allows EC2 instances to "learn about themselves" without using IAM Role.
	Metadata: Info about the EC2 Instance.
	Userdata: Launch script of the EC2 instance.
	
	" curl ": Query a URL
	Accessible INFORMATION WITHOUT AN IAM ROLE: Any EC2 can access.
		->" curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id " 
		

AWS CLI PROFILES:		Manage having multiple AWS Accounts.
	->" cd ~/.aws "
	->" cat config "
	->" cat credentials "
	->" aws configure --profile <PROFILE_NAME> "
	->" cat config "
	->" cat credentials "

	->" aws s3 ls ": Access s3 on DEFAULT ACCOUNT.
	->" aws s3 ls --profile <PROFILE_NAME> ": Access s3 on SPECIFIED ACCOUNT.


AWS SDK:
	API CREDENTIALS SECURITY: Recommended to use default credential provider chain

	   --------------NEVER EVER STORE AWS CREDENTIALS IN YOUR CODE-------------

API EXPONENTIAL BACKOFF: Any API that fails because of too many calls need to be retried with Exponential Backoff.
